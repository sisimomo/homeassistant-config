## Software:

## What it does:

 - Controls living room lights.
 - Tracks our phones using gpslogger and find and therefore knows whether or not anybody is at home.
 - Notifies us of key events via telegram.
 - Voice control with Tasker and API.AI

			

...which you can browse through in this repo.

At some point in the future I will try and put some more detailed comments on the more important/complicated bits.  In the meantime, if I can clarify anything for anyone, just let me know.
